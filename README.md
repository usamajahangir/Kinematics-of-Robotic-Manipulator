# Kinematics-of-Robotic-Manipulator

In this project serial robotic manipulator by "BCN3D Moveo" is taken for kinematic modelling in using MATLAB and petercorke Robotics Toolbox

Description of files is as follows:
"Transformations_Matrics.m" contains code to generate transformations matrics using DH parameters./n
"Forward_Kinematics.m" takes joint angles as input and calculate the resultant transformation matrics./n
"Inverse Kinematics.m" takes a target transformation matrics and calculate the joint angles based on inverse kinematics equations derived using algebric method.
"Workspace.m" uses petercorke Robotics Toolbox to generate the workspace of the manipulator using the DH parameters.
